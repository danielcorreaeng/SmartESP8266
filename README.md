# SmartESP8266

Project for residential automation for ESP8266 NodeMcu board using arduino IDE with IR controller, MQTT and command line based HTTP request.

## Final note

I concluded that the best model is to use infrared with http and use a third program to manage the rest. 
In my case, I used the homeassistant (https://home-assistant.io/) and returned to the IR-Blaster model (https://github.com/mdhiggins/ESP8266-HTTP-IR-Blaster)
